This is a web development exam with focus on frontend. You shall recreate a design that you get both screenshots and video of, by using the techniques we have worked with in recent periods. This means you must among other things use semantic HTML, CSS Grid and/or Flexbox to design the website, have order and structure in both the file system and your code.

Details about the design you shall recreate using HTML and CSS:

- The website shall contain a front page and a subpage. In other words, you shall write code for 2 HTML documents.
- It should be possible to click on links to navigate between the pages. The "Home" link in the navbar should go to the front page (`index.html`), and when you click on any image on the front page, you should come to the subpage (`side2.html`). All links on the images thus lead you to the same page.
- The front page (**index**) shall follow the design from the screenshots here, where you must notice that the design changes based on screen size:
    - [Screenshot 1](design-side1-bilde1.png)
    - [Screenshot 2](design-side1-bilde2.png)
    - [Screenshot 3](design-side1-bilde3.png)
- The subpage (**side2**) shall follow the design from the screenshots here, where you again must notice that the design changes based on screen size:
    - [Screenshot 1](design-side2-bilde1.png)
    - [Screenshot 2](design-side2-bilde2.png)
    - [Screenshot 3](design-side2-bilde3.png)
- You can also see a video of how the website should look, behave under different screen sizes, as well as how the navigation works:

## File Structure
You should typically have the following file structure:
```

    /index.html
    /side2.html
    /css
        /index.css
        /side2.css
    /images
        /image1.jpg
        /image2.jpg

## Submission
Submission of what you have produced during the exam will be in the form of a zip file. Alternatively via a GitHub repo. Regardless, it should include a clear student name in the folder and zip file.

Here's how you do it:
1. Pack the folder with all content in a zip file. Name the zip file like this: `web-development-exam-october-2025-student-name.zip`
